Technical Projects - Sentry Team:
- Developed a radar-less targeting system that leveraged computer vision for accurate object detection, tracking, and elimination 
- Worked on a small team of students to develop a mobile, durable, and cost-effective sentry system that can detect, target, and destroy small enemy aircraft such as drones
 -Worked with Texas Instruments mmWave radar sensors to develop an accurate active radar detection and targeting system
- Wrote code to establish and coordinate communication between the active radar system and the mechanical system to aim and sustain target lock on aerial targets
